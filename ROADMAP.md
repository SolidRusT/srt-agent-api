# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the future objectives and plans for the `srt-web-chat` project.

## Current Status

The project currently supports the following functionalities:

- Chat module with API and CLI interfaces.
- API endpoints for fetching data, wiki summaries, and web searches.
- Configurable via `config.yaml`.
- CI/CD pipeline set up for automated testing.

## Future Objectives

### New Module Ideas

1. **Translation Module**
   - Implement a tool to translate text using an LLM provider.

2. **Sentiment Analysis Module**
   - Create a tool to analyze the sentiment of text inputs.

3. **Summarization Module**
   - Develop a module for text summarization, different from the wiki summary.

4. **Entity Recognition Module**
   - Implement a tool that identifies and extracts entities from text.

### Reviewing Examples from `llama-cpp-agent` Repository

1. **Incorporate More Tools**
   - Explore additional tools provided by the `llama-cpp-agent` and see how they can be integrated.

2. **Refine Existing Modules**
   - Use examples to refine and enhance current modules, improving their functionality and performance.

3. **New Functionality**
   - Explore new functionalities that can be added to our current setup.

### Improve Documentation and Developer Experience

1. **API Documentation**
   - Create detailed API documentation using tools like Swagger.

2. **Example Use Cases**
   - Provide more example use cases and code snippets for developers.

3. **Tutorials and Guides**
   - Develop tutorials and guides to help new users get started with the project.

### Enhance Testing and CI/CD

1. **Increase Test Coverage**
   - Write more unit and integration tests to cover all functionalities.

2. **Automate Deployment**
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate deployment to a cloud service.

3. **Mocking External Services**
   - Ensure tests don't rely on external services by mocking them.

### Build Frontend UI
